- ðŸ‘‹ Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Nihar
- ðŸ‘€ Product Manager
âœ¨ My background includes corporate and freelance experience in the tech industry, with a history of Web and Mobile Application Development. I have worked on multiple projects across different business domains ranging from startups to large scale businesses. Iâ€™ve worked in the software industry for years with a combination of well-reputed local and international businesses.

Technology excites me like magic. Creating a user-centric digital experience is always what I wished to create, to get the user attracted, engaged, and then diverted towards the business. The initiation of my fascinating professional career in web and app development always had the goal to turn the ideas into real-life solutions. I have always been full of enthusiasm and technology gives life to the enthusiastic me!
